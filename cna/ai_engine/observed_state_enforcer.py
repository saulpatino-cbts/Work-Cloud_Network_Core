"""Observed-state enforcer — Phase D (DD-002).

Every finding MUST describe an observed fact.
This enforcer blocks findings that contain hedge language — words that indicate
assumption rather than observation.

Hedge word list is intentionally conservative. If a word is borderline,
it goes on the list. Engineers can request removal via design doc amendment.
