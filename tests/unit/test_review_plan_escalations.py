"""Unit tests for escalation wiring in the consolidated plan (spec task 14.3).

Covers the escalation-wiring assertion layer over
:func:`cna.review.build_remediation_plan`: :func:`cna.review.escalation_summary`
and :func:`cna.review.assert_escalations_well_formed`.

The invariant under test (Requirements 1.6, 10.4) is that every
``Escalation_Record`` entry carries its owning ``REVIEW.md`` blocker id, no
fixable entry carries a blocker id, and the escalations cover exactly the
R-001..R-006, R-008, R-009 consumers this review declares. R-007 is
resolved-but-not-closed, so its subject stays entirely out of scope and it is
*not* an escalation consumer.
