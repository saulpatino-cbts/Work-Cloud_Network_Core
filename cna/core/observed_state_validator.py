"""Observed-state validator for AI-generated findings.

Closes TODO_PhaseA: DD-002 and DD-008 are policies, not controls.

The problem: `observed_state` is a required string field. A model could write
'this is likely a dev environment' and pass schema validation. That is an
assumption masquerading as an observed fact.

This module implements a two-layer control:

  Layer 1 — Linguistic hedge detector:
    Scans observed_state text for assumption language patterns.
    Words like 'likely', 'probably', 'appears to be', 'seems', 'may be',
    'could be', 'we assume' are prohibited.
    Raises ObservedStateViolation with the offending phrase.

  Layer 2 — Evidence linkage check:
    Every observed_state must reference at least one evidence_id from the
    engagement's collected topology data.
    If the finding has no evidence_ids, it cannot be verified as grounded.
    Raises ObservedStateViolation with remediation guidance.

This runs on every finding before it enters the findings store.
AI pipeline (Phase D) calls validate_finding() before persisting.
