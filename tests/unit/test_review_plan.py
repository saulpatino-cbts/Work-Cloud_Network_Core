"""Unit tests for the consolidated ``Remediation_Plan`` builder (spec task 14.1).

Covers :func:`cna.review.build_remediation_plan`, the CONSOLIDATE-stage entry
point that gathers every owner area's ``Finding`` records, routes each through
the ``REVIEW.md`` scope gate, and folds them into one severity-ordered
``Remediation_Plan``.

The concrete coverage assertions here (Requirements 1.1, 1.4, 1.5, 4.1, 5.1,
7.1) check that the single plan represents every subject in each area's fixed
expected set:

  * all nine owner areas are represented across the plan's ``referenced_areas``;
  * the eight AWS module boundaries (ai, compute, database, identity,
    observability, runtime, security, storage) appear as subjects;
  * all 14 CI workflows appear as subjects;
  * the four service Dockerfiles and ``docker-compose.yml`` appear as subjects.

Property 2 (the universal area-coverage invariant) is spec task 14.2's dedicated
property test; this module asserts the concrete coverage of the real plan.
