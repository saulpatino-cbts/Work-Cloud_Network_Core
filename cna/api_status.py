"""Single outcome→HTTP-status mapping for the CNA API.

Requirement 2 (production-readiness) requires that every API response reflect
the *actual* result of the operation: a successful outcome returns a 2xx
status, and a failed outcome returns the 4xx or 5xx status whose class matches
the failure category (client error → 4xx, server or downstream error → 5xx).
No handler may return a 200 on an error path.

Historically each handler hard-coded its own status literals, so the guarantee
lived only in reviewers' heads. This module makes it a single, testable
function: an :class:`Outcome` names a domain outcome category, and
:func:`status_for` maps it to the one HTTP status code that carries the
matching class. Property 10 (design) pins the invariant — the mapping is a pure
function whose class placement (2xx / 4xx / 5xx) matches the outcome category.

FastAPI handlers select an :class:`Outcome` and pass :func:`status_for` to the
response (or ``HTTPException``) rather than repeating raw integers, so the
success→2xx / failure→matching-4xx-or-5xx contract cannot silently drift.
