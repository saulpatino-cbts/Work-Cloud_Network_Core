"""Unit tests for the production-readiness blocker model and scope gate.

Example and edge-case coverage for :mod:`cna.review.blockers` — parsing the
``REVIEW.md`` status table, the CLOSED-vs-not-closed status classification
(Requirement 10.3, where a ``resolved`` label alone is *not* closed), and the
scope gate that turns a not-closed blocker's finding into an ``Escalation_Record``
while a closed blocker's finding stays fixable (Requirements 10.1, 10.2, 10.4).

The universal invariants for gated escalation and scope-gate consistency are
covered separately by the property tests (tasks 2.3/2.4).
