"""Verification of the ``app-typescript`` area (spec task 5.3, Requirements 1.1/1.2).

Task 5.1 recorded the app-area type-safety / error-handling audit (in
``apps/cna-web/REVIEW_FINDINGS.md``) and task 5.2 recorded the AWS-view alignment
entries (in :mod:`cna.review.areas.app_typescript`). This module closes the area
by running the executed verification the design's "1. App / TypeScript"
*Verification* line calls for — ``npm run lint``, ``npm run build`` (type-check +
production build), and ``tsc --noEmit`` where a standalone type-check is faster —
and recording the result as structured :class:`~cna.review.model.Finding`
records the task-14 consolidation engine can ingest.

What was run
------------

In ``apps/cna-web`` (Node v26, npm v11):

  * ``npm ci`` — installed 581 packages cleanly (exit 0). Install scripts are not
    run by default under this npm's ``allow-scripts`` policy, so the Prisma
    client was generated explicitly with ``npx prisma generate`` (exit 0) before
    the type-check/build, which need the generated ``@prisma/client`` types.
  * ``npx tsc --noEmit`` — **clean (exit 0)**. This is the fast standalone
    type-check the design allows and it directly exercises the task-5.1/5.2
    TypeScript edits (``lib/summarize-error.ts`` ``sanitizeBackendDetail`` /
    generalized ``summarizeErrorText``, the ``lib/auth.ts`` unknown-narrowed
    error ``type`` accessor, and the ``sanitizeBackendDetail`` call sites in the
    chat route and the ``client-deliverables`` / ``cloud-credentials`` actions).
    None introduced a type error.
  * ``npm run build`` (``next build``) — **succeeds (exit 0)**: "Compiled
    successfully", the in-build "Running TypeScript" step passes, and all routes
    are generated. This confirms the same edits build end-to-end under the
    production compiler, not only the standalone type-checker. The build also
    emitted a non-fatal deprecation notice: the ``middleware`` file convention is
    deprecated in Next 16 in favour of ``proxy`` (recorded below as a LOW
    residual gap, not a blocker).

Residual gap found
------------------

  * ``npm run lint`` — **fails (exit 1)**. The ``lint`` script is
    ``next lint``, which Next.js 16 removed; it errors with "Invalid project
    directory provided, no such directory: .../lint". Running ESLint 10 directly
    also fails because there is no flat-config file: "ESLint couldn't find an
    eslint.config.(js|mjs|cjs) file" (ESLint v9+ requires flat config; the
    project has neither ``eslint.config.*`` nor a legacy ``.eslintrc.*``). So the
    web area currently has **no runnable lint step** — a genuine
    verification-coverage gap, recorded as a MEDIUM fixable finding rather than a
    silent pass. ``eslint`` and ``eslint-config-next`` are already installed, so
    the fix is to add an ``eslint.config.mjs`` flat config (e.g. via
    ``@eslint/eslintrc``'s ``FlatCompat`` around ``next/core-web-vitals``) and
    repoint the ``lint`` script at ``eslint .``.

The type-check and build outcomes are recorded as ``INFORMATIONAL``
verified-compliant findings (they passed and confirm the 5.1/5.2 edits are
sound); the broken lint step and the ``middleware`` deprecation are recorded as
fixable residual gaps. Every finding here is a **fixable app-area finding** with
no ``blocker_id`` — running lint/build and migrating the middleware convention
need no AWS account or gated resource. These records are consumed by the
consolidation step (spec task 14.1).
