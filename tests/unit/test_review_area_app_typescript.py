"""Unit tests for the ``app-typescript`` AWS-view alignment findings (Req 4.4).

Covers the verify-then-close-gaps record for the AWS-view alignment audit (spec
task 5.2): the credential-capture surface is verified compliant (already
AWS-shaped), and each remaining Azure-shaped AWS-facing view (the discovery
topology summary, the subscription/tenant connection framing, and the inventory
label / connection help) is recorded as its own fixable ``Remediation_Plan``
entry. The load-bearing invariant is that every 4.4 entry is a fixable app-area
finding — none carries a ``blocker_id`` — because aligning the views to the AWS
deployment model needs no AWS account (design section "4. Terraform AWS"
escalation boundary).
