"""Review data model for the production-hardening review.

These are the plain records every area reviewer emits into and that the
consolidation engine collapses into a single ``Remediation_Plan``. The shapes
match the ``production-readiness`` spec design ("Data Models"):

  * :class:`Severity` — an ``IntEnum`` ordering findings from ``INFORMATIONAL``
    (0) to ``CRITICAL`` (4), so ``severity``-descending ordering is a plain
    numeric sort and merged entries can take the ``max``.
  * :data:`AREAS` — the closed set of the nine fixed owner areas. Every
    ``Finding.area`` is drawn only from this set.
  * :class:`Finding`, :class:`PlanEntry`, :class:`RemediationPlan` — the raw
    finding, a consolidated plan entry, and the ordered plan.

Well-formedness (design Property 1) is enforced at construction time: an
invalid ``severity``, an ``area`` outside :data:`AREAS`, or an empty
``proposed_action`` raises :class:`ValueError` rather than producing a
malformed record that would flow silently into the plan.
