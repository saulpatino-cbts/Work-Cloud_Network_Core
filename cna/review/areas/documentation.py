"""Findings for the ``documentation`` area (Requirement 9).

This is the *verify-then-close-gaps* record for the documentation audit: the
four required documents (``README.md``, ``CHANGELOG.md``, ``REVIEW.md``,
``TODO.md``) plus the one optional working document (``CNA-0.90-updates.md``),
cross-checked against the actual repository tree, plus the still-open doc-task
entries and the R-009 Wiki-publication escalation.

Facts cross-checked during the audit (design "9. Documentation", Requirement
9.1) — all verified accurate, recorded as ``INFORMATIONAL`` verified-compliant
findings so the plan captures what was checked, not only what broke:

  * **Version.** ``README``/quick-start imply the platform version; the
    packaged version in ``pyproject.toml`` is ``0.8.0b0`` and the spec/intro
    calls the platform ``v0.8.0b0`` — consistent.
  * **CLI entry point.** ``README`` documents the ``cna`` CLI
    (``pip install -e .[dev]`` → ``cna --help``); ``pyproject.toml`` declares
    ``[project.scripts] cna = "cna.cli.main:cli"`` — consistent.
  * **Four-document model.** ``README``'s documentation map claims exactly four
    required markdown files plus at most one optional temporary working
    document. The repository root carries exactly ``README.md``,
    ``CHANGELOG.md``, ``REVIEW.md``, ``TODO.md`` and the one optional
    ``CNA-0.90-updates.md`` — consistent.
  * **Numbered workflows.** ``README`` conventions describe numeric workflow
    bands and reference specific workflows (``300-test-codebase.yml``,
    ``310-release-version.yml``, ``340-sync-keys.yml``). All 14 numbered
    workflows exist under ``.github/workflows/`` and every referenced filename
    resolves — consistent (the stale ``110-sync-keys.yml`` reference was already
    corrected under ``TODO.md`` T-102).

Executable status of documented paths (Requirement 9.2):

  * **Python CLI quick start.** ``README`` documents ``pip install -e .[dev]``
    then ``cna --help``. The CLI cannot be run from a bare checkout: importing
    ``cna.cli.main`` pulls runtime dependencies (e.g. ``pydantic``) that are
    only present after the documented install step. The documented path is
    therefore *executable only after* its own install prerequisite — recorded so
    the plan states the path's executable status rather than assuming it runs.
  * **AWS deploy path.** ``README`` states Azure is the deployable path today and
    the AWS Terraform is authored but never applied, its prerequisites tracked in
    ``REVIEW.md``. That documented status is accurate: the AWS deploy path is not
    executable pending the human-gated account prerequisites (R-001–R-006), so it
    is recorded as documented-non-executable-by-design, not a defect.

Open doc tasks (Requirement 9.3). Of T-103, T-304, T-401 — checked against
``TODO.md`` current status:

  * **T-103** — *Not started* → OPEN. Recorded as a plan entry.
  * **T-304** — *Not started — not currently applicable* → OPEN. Recorded as a
    plan entry (a not-currently-applicable open task is still open work).
  * **T-401** — *Done* → CLOSED. Not recorded as an open-task entry; recorded
    instead as a verified-compliant ``INFORMATIONAL`` finding so the plan shows
    the task was checked and found closed.

Escalation (Requirement 9.4). Publishing the prepared Wiki pages depends on
GitHub Wiki write access, which is scoped out (``REVIEW.md`` R-009, "Open — not
blocking"). Recorded as an ``Escalation_Record`` carrying ``blocker_id="R-009"``
— the review never attempts the publication. These records are consumed by the
consolidation step (spec task 14.1) and, for the escalation, routed through the
scope gate (spec task 2.1 / 14.3).
