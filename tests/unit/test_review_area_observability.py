"""Unit tests for the ``observability`` area findings (Requirement 8).

Covers the verify-then-close-gaps record for the observability audit (spec task
12.1): the structured-logging audit across the API, web, and core engine (8.1 /
8.2 — two verified-compliant surfaces plus the API basicConfig gap this task
closes), and the AI-path coverage requirement (8.3 — a fixable trace/span +
token-usage entry and the R-005 live-Bedrock escalation). The load-bearing
invariants are that only the live-Bedrock finding is blocker-owned (R-005) and
that it gates to an ``Escalation_Record``.
