"""Worker-retirement decision test for task 4.6 (Requirement 2.5).

Task 4.6 pairs the FastAPI ``TestClient`` error-path tests (see
``test_cna_api_error_paths.py``) with an assertion of the recorded
worker-retirement entry. This test lives in its own module — separate from the
``TestClient`` suite — because it only reads the review findings via
:func:`cna.review.areas.python_engine_api_findings` and therefore has **no**
dependency on the API's runtime stack (fastapi / httpx / psycopg2). It runs in
every environment, including the minimal ``cna``-only checkout where the
``TestClient`` suite is skipped.

Requirement 2.5: where the Worker_Service is confirmed a retirement candidate,
the review records a ``Remediation_Plan`` entry stating whether it is retired or
retained with a defined responsibility. The design records the decision as
**retire** — the ``apps/cna-api`` ``POST /publish`` endpoint supersedes the
``apps/cna-worker`` placeholder.
