## [Unreleased]

---

## [0.8.0-beta] - 2026-06-16

### Added
- Added Azure Front Door Premium private-origin hardening, private endpoint approval automation, Azure Firewall egress control, subnet-specific NSGs, centralized diagnostics, VNet flow logs, and Azure AI Foundry private access validation gates.
- Added network security ADFs for edge ingress, east-west segmentation, north-south egress, private PaaS connectivity, centralized logging, Front Door private origin, private endpoint approval automation, and virtual network flow logs.
- Added post-deploy Foundry validation from the web Container App to verify private DNS resolution and managed-identity inference.

### Changed
- Changed the project release posture from `1.0.0` to `0.8 beta` while beta validation remains open.
- Updated Terraform, workflows, and documentation to use `cna-*` naming, separate tfstate resource groups, and GitHub Secrets/Variables as the deployment source of truth.
- Updated the AI runtime decision model so Foundry Claude is the Terraform-managed private provider and Azure OpenAI remains optional and out-of-band unless promoted to a first-class Terraform-managed provider.
- Merged or manually landed all open Dependabot PRs and closed the remaining conflicted PRs after their exact dependency updates reached `main`.
- Confirmed GitHub has no open PRs and no open Issues for final beta sync.

### Validation
- `npm ci`, `npx prisma generate`, and `npm run build` passed after dependency updates.
- Terraform validation passed for Azure `dev` and `prod` after network hardening changes.
- Final live Azure beta validation remains tracked in `TODO.md`.

## [1.0.0-prep] - 2026-06-15

### Changed
- Standardized active Azure deployment naming on `cna-*` resources with `rg-cna-<env>-<region>` workload resource groups.
- Updated Terraform workload resource group naming and generic CNA tag defaults for customer deployments.
- Aligned deployment, workflow, cleanup, and secrets documentation with GitHub Secrets/Variables as the source of truth.
- Migrated the documentation content set to the GitHub Wiki with generated table-of-contents sections.
- Migrated ADRs to the GitHub Wiki, consolidated remaining gap/footprint notes into `TODO.md`, and removed obsolete local audit artifacts.
